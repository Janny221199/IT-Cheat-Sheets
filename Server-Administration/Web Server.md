A web server is a software that listens for incoming connections and then utilises the [HTTP](../Networks/HTTP.md) protocol to deliver web content to its clients. The most common web server software you'll come across is Apache, Nginx, IIS and NodeJS. A Web server delivers files from what's called its root directory, which is defined in the software settings. For example, Nginx and Apache share the same default location of `/var/www/html` in Linux operating systems. So, for example, if you requested the file `http://URL/picture.jpg`, it would send the file `/var/www/html/picture.jpg` from its local hard drive.

## Virtual Hosts
Web servers can host multiple websites with different domain names; to achieve this, they use virtual hosts. The web server software checks the hostname being requested from the HTTP headers and matches that against its virtual hosts (virtual hosts are just text-based configuration files). If it finds a match, the correct website will be provided. If no match is found, the default website will be provided instead.

Virtual Hosts can have their root directory mapped to different locations on the hard drive. For example, `http://one.com` being mapped to `/var/www/website_one`, and `two.com` being mapped to `/var/www/website_two`
